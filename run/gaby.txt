hey gaby... how are u?...
bla bla,
I wanted to speak with you about the dinner you have later, i wasn't gonna say anything but then i couldn't stop thinking about it and I will at all times say the truth to you. 

When we talked earlier i said ur are the only person that I see apart, from my family ofc, and u also said that u only see 3 people , bruno , me and Joana, and that's okay, but then u accept this kind of invitations, which i understand but i dont agree. It kinda puts me in a weird position, cause ofc i love you and i really want to spend time with you as much as i can, even tho i am scared that me and my parents catch it the virus , because the situation now it getting really serious.

I am not mad at you or anything, because as i said earlier i understand the pressure u must get from them to you to join, but i what i dont understand
